# Chess
This engine uses algebraic notation for the moves based on FIDE standards. Every legal move can be made now.
I haven't started the chess computer player part yet.
The human vs human part is completed; move validation for every piece, special moves like en passant, castling, and promotions are all in place. Checkmate, stalemate, and regular check seem to work properly. Draws cannot be claimed after 50 moves without capturing a piece or moving a pawn yet, nor is it possible to offer a draw, or claim a draw after 3 repetitions of the same position on the board.
